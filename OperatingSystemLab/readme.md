## Overview

Welcome to the Operating System Lab repository! This repository serves as a practical resource for students studying operating systems, featuring hands-on projects and examples to enhance understanding.

## FCFS Scheduler GUI

### Project Overview

The FCFS Scheduler GUI is a Java-based desktop application designed to illustrate the basic principles of process scheduling in operating systems. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing users to input the arrival times and burst times of processes. The application then visualizes the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling algorithm in action.

### Features

- **Interactive Input:** Users can enter the number of processes, as well as the arrival and burst times for each process through an intuitive graphical interface.
  
- **FCFS Scheduling:** The project implements the FCFS scheduling algorithm, a simple and straightforward approach that schedules processes based on their arrival times.

- **Sortable Display:** Scheduling results are presented in a tabular format, with columns for process ID, arrival time, burst time, completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time.

- **Clear Functionality:** A "Clear" button allows users to reset input fields easily, providing a seamless way to initiate new simulations.

- **Average Metrics:** The project calculates and displays average waiting time and average turnaround time for the executed FCFS scheduling.
